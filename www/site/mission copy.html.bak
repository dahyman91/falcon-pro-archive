    in 1992 by Enrico Falconi, Falcon Production&#8217;s intent was to make extremely 
    low-budget films that are entertaining, artistic and attempt to evoke some 
    redeeming social commentary. Thus was born their first documentary (in progress),<em><strong> 
    Experience, the Robin Nolan Story</strong></em>. Scheduled for release in 
    the fall of 2004, the film is a journey into sound, chronicling the life and 
    career of a virtuoso Gypsy jazz guitarist from Amsterdam over an eleven-year 
    period. In 1995, the company produced it&#8217;s first short film <em><strong>Thinking 
    About Chocolate</strong></em>, starring Michael Buscemi. Shot on 16mm film, 
    it was written, produced and directed by Enrico Falconi for approximately 
    $6,000. <br>
    <br>
    In 1999, Enrico Falconi co-produced<em><strong> Man Woman Film</strong></em>, 
    a $40,000 b&amp;w feature film, written, produced and directed by Cameron 
    Pearson. Featuring Cameron Diaz as a random celebrity, it screened at over 
    20 festivals globally and was under consideration by the Director&#8217;s 
    Fortnight at Cannes 2000 before being disqualified for having previously screened 
    outside of its country of origin. In the fall of 2000 Cameron Pearson &amp; 
    Enrico Falconi again collaborated, this time on the short film<em><strong> 
    Alsjeblieft</strong></em>. Shot entirely on location in Amsterdam, Holland 
    during their stay as invited filmmakers at the CINESTUD Film Festival, the 
    film was written, produced and directed by the two filmmakers, as well as 
    starring them both. <br>

    In 2001, Falcon Productions began work on a film trilogy with Rural Kids, 
    a collaborative of teenage artists based in upstate New York. Written, produced 
    and starring three 14-year-old boys, the first installment was the zany comedy-horror<em><strong> 
    Angry</strong></em> <em><strong>Jenkins&#8217; Farm</strong></em>. In 2002, 
    the group collaborated on the twisted tale of out-of-control youth in <em><strong>Go 
    To Jail.</strong></em> And in 2002/3, they produced 1937. Co-written by ten-year-old 
    Daniel Hyman, <em><strong>1937</strong></em> was one of the films submitted 
    by Falcon Productions for consideration by the Cannes Film Festival in 2003. 
    The second 2003 submission is Falcon Productions&#8217; first experimental 
    film project <em><strong>Original Black Poet</strong></em>. Inspired by a 
    day of volunteering at NYC&#8217;s ground zero in September 2001, the film 
    is a poetic response to the mad rush to war and an outcry for peace. Although 
    <em> <strong>1937</strong></em> was not accepted to the festival we arranged 
    for a screening at the Marche du Film 2003. This year we&#8217;ll be screening 
    a short film version of our documentary,<em><strong> Experience</strong></em>, 
    at the Short Film Corner in the Marche. <br>
    <br>
    Coming soon: in spring 2004<em><strong> Daddy&#8217;s Little Girl</strong></em>, 
    written &amp; directed by 16 year old Oliver Noble and <em><strong>Cropsy</strong></em> 
    a bone chilling horror, based on the legend of Cropsy.</font></font></p>
