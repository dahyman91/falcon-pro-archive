<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Established 
  in 1992 by Enrico &#8220;Henri&#8221; Falconi, Falcon Production&#8217;s intent 
  was to make extremely low-budget films that are entertaining, artistic and attempt 
  to evoke some redeeming social commentary. Thus was born their first documentary 
  (in progress), <em><strong>Experience, the Robin Nolan Story .</strong></em> 
  Scheduled for release in the fall of 2006, the film is a journey into sound, 
  chronicling the life and career of a virtuoso Gypsy jazz guitarist from Amsterdam. 
  In 1995, the company produced it&#8217;s first short film <em><strong>Thinking 
  About Chocolate</strong></em> , starring Michael Buscemi. Shot on 16mm film, 
  it was written, produced and directed by Enrico Falconi for approximately $6,000. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1999, Enrico Falconi co-produced <em><strong>Man Woman Film</strong></em> 
  , a $40,000 b&amp;w feature film, written, produced and directed by Cameron 
  Pearson. Featuring Cameron Diaz as a random celebrity, it screened at over 20 
  festivals globally and was under consideration by the Director&#8217;s Fortnight 
  at Cannes 2000 before being disqualified for having previously screened outside 
  of its country of origin. In the fall of 2000 Cameron Pearson &amp; Enrico Falconi 
  again collaborated, this time on the short film <em><strong>Alsjeblieft</strong></em> 
  . Shot entirely on location in Amsterdam, Holland during their stay as invited 
  filmmakers at the CINESTUD Film Festival, the film was written, produced and 
  directed by the two filmmakers, as well as starring them both. <br>
  <br>
  In 2001, Falcon Productions began work on a film trilogy with Rural Kids, a 
  collaborative of teenage artists based in upstate New York. Written, produced 
  and starring three 14-year-old boys, the first installment was the zany comedy-horror 
  <em> <strong>Angry Jenkins&#8217; Farm</strong></em> . In 2002, the group collaborated 
  on the twisted tale of out-of-control youth in <em><strong>Go To Jail</strong></em>. 
  And in 2002/3, they produced <em><strong>1937</strong></em>. Co-written by ten-year-old 
  Daniel Hyman, <em><strong>1937</strong></em> was one of the films submitted 
  by Falcon Productions for consideration by the Cannes Film Festival in 2003. 
  The second 2003 submission is Falcon Productions&#8217; first experimental film 
  project <em><strong>Original Black Poet</strong></em> . Inspired by a day of 
  volunteering at NYC&#8217;s ground zero in September 2001, the film is a poetic 
  response to the mad rush to war and an outcry for peace. Although <em><strong>1937</strong></em> 
  was not accepted to the festival we arranged for a screening at the Marche du 
  Film 2003. In 2004 we screened a short film version of our documentary, <em><strong>Experience</strong></em> 
  , at the Short Film Corner in the Marche. Falcon Productions just released their 
  first live music DVD,<em><strong> Live At Langley</strong></em>, recorded live 
  at Djangofest Northwest 2003, this unique DVD features long time friend and 
  subject, Robin Nolan in one of his most brilliant and masterful performances.

  Beer Run and Cannes, sir</strong></em>,<br>
