# Modify this file to your liking!  But make sure the requests you set up in your HTML files #
# match the names you add here!                                                              #
#                                                                                            #
# To customize your own images, just follow the example of the images provided with this     #
# script (found in the images directory).  You'll name each image file                       # 
# [style name][number].gif.  For example: odometer1.gif.                                     #
# Once you've created the image files, make an entry in this setup file (like one of the     #
# defaults provided below).  The name of the style and the name of the images don't have to  #
# be the same.  But to make things simple, you might want to make sure they are the same.    #
# For each image style, you'll need to provide the name in braces [] on it's own line.  Then #
# you will need to provide the name of the file with it's extension (.gif .jpg .png) on the  #
# line below.  Don't put any numbers after the image name and before the extension.  The     #
# script will do that for you.  So odometer.gif will automatically be converted to           #
# odometer5.gif if the number five is required by the counter.                               #
#                                                                                            #
# Text styles are a little bit easier.  They can be any single-line chunk of HTML you wish.  #
# All you need to do is put the word "COUNTER" in all-caps where you want the counter number #
# to appear.                                                                                 #
